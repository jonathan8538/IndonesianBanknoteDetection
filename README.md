# IndonesianBanknoteDetection
I use YoloV8 model to detect indonesian banknotes application and based on the metrics report, the result is quite good. Then i apply the model in a html with a voice recognition function to start and end detection.

How to use:
you can use vscode to view live the html file then it will automatically tell us the menu ('Mulai deteksi' and 'Stop Deteksi'), since you have opened the file, it automatically detect your voice input. So just speak as the menu available.
